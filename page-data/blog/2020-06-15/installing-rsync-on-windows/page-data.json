It is assumed that you already have <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Git for Windows</a> installed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/rsync_windows.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of rsync running in PowerShell\" title=\"rsync screenshot\"></p>\n<p>If you didn't already know, Git for Windows and its Git Bash environment is built using <a href=\"http://msys2.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">msys2</a>, but it doesn't include all the binaries from that project. One of the binaries that exists, but that isn't included, is rsync. So what we need to do is to download the msys2 rsync binary, and place it somewhere Git Bash can find it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"http://repo.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://repo.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/</a> and download the latest version of rsync (not rsync2). At the time of this writing that is rsync-3.1.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz</li>\n<li>Extract the downloaded archive. I'm using Total Commander with a .xz plugin, but 7-zip is also a great option. Download and install from <a href=\"https://www.7-zip.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.7-zip.org/</a> if you need to.</li>\n<li>Copy the contents of the extracted archive (sub-folders and all) to where you have Git for Windows installed. For me that's <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Program Files\\Git\\</code>. (The archive contains a <code class=\"language-text\">\\usr</code> folder, and so does the git installation directory. What you want is for everything inside of the <code class=\"language-text\">\\usr</code> folder in the archive to end up in the <code class=\"language-text\">\\usr</code> folder in the git installation directory, ultimately ending up with, among other files, <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\rsync.exe</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's it. You now have rsync installed. You can test your installation by opening up a Git Bash command line window and running <code class=\"language-text\">rsync --version</code>. You should see it print out version information.</p>\n<p>Now, if you want to use rsync from the Windows Command Prompt, or from PowerShell, there is one more step.</p>\n<p>Create a new <code class=\"language-text\">.bat</code> file with the following content (adjust the path to match your environment)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"batch\"><pre class=\"language-batch\"><code class=\"language-batch\">\"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\rsync.exe\" %* </code></pre></div>\n<p>Name the file <code class=\"language-text\">rsync.bat</code> and place it somewhere in your %PATH%. I placed mine in <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Windows\\</code>. Press <span class=\"nowrap\"><kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd></span> and enter <code class=\"language-text\">cmd</code>. In the Command Prompt window that you just launched, enter <code class=\"language-text\">rsync --version</code> and it will find your <code class=\"language-text\">.bat</code>-file and run it, passing all arguments (that's what <code class=\"language-text\">%*</code> does in the command above) off to your newly installed rsync.exe</p>\n<p>The first three steps above are based on <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/questions/310337/using-rsync-from-msysgit-for-binary-files/872557#872557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://serverfault.com/questions/310337/using-rsync-from-msysgit-for-binary-files/872557#872557</a> where you can also find instructions for setting up Pageant for SSH, if that's something you need.</p>\n<p>I hope this short tutorial was useful to you. Happy rsyncing!</p>","excerpt":"This guide will help you install rsync on Windows 10. It is assumed that you already have Git for Windows installed.

You will probably see some warnings about missing peer dependencies when installing, but those can safely be ignored.</p>\n<p>Running all the tests takes a little while however, so when working on a specific feature it's somethimes helpful to be able to just run the tests for a specific package, or even just a specific test. So that's what I want to show here.</p>\n<p>Let's say for example you want to run the tests for the <code class=\"language-text\">cli</code> package. First, go in to the cli directory; <code class=\"language-text\">cd packages/cli</code>. Then run all the tests by issuing <code class=\"language-text\">yarn test</code> (or <code class=\"language-text\">yarn jest</code>).</p>\n<p>For more granularity you can run a single test-file by passing the path to it to jest. Here's the command and example output from running the page generator tests.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ yarn test src/commands/generate/page/__tests__/page.test.js\nyarn run v1.22.4\n$ jest src/commands/generate/page/__tests__/page.test.js\n FAIL  src/commands/generate/page/__tests__/page.test.js (5.467s)\n  √ returns exactly 2 files (4ms)\n  × creates a page component (4ms)\n  × creates a page test\n  × creates a page component (1ms)\n  × creates a page test (2ms)\n  √ creates a single-word route name (1ms)\n  √ creates a camelCase route name for multiple word names (1ms)\n  √ creates a path equal to passed path</code></pre></div>\n<p>To run just one of the testcases, open up the test-file in your code editor, find the test definition and add <code class=\"language-text\">.only</code> to it. E.g. changing it from <code class=\"language-text\">test(&#39;creates a page test&#39;, () =&gt; {</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">test.only(&#39;creates a page test&#39;, () =&gt; {</code>. Run the test file again, and only the selected test case will execute. You can add <code class=\"language-text\">.only</code> to however many tests you like, and all the selected tests will run. The other tests in the file will be skipped.</p>\n<p>Example output when selecting three testcases to run</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ yarn test src/commands/generate/page/__tests__/page.test.js\nyarn run v1.22.4\n$ jest src/commands/generate/page/__tests__/page.test.js\n PASS  src/commands/generate/page/__tests__/page.test.js (5.598s)\n  √ creates a page test (3ms)\n  √ creates a page test (1ms)\n  √ creates a page component with a plural word for name\n  ○ skipped returns exactly 2 files\n  ○ skipped creates a page component\n  ○ skipped creates a page component\n  ○ skipped creates a single-word route name\n  ○ skipped creates a camelCase route name for multiple word names\n  ○ skipped creates a path equal to passed path\n\nTest Suites: 1 passed, 1 total\nTests:       6 skipped, 3 passed, 9 total\nSnapshots:   0 total\nTime:        7.306s\nRan all test suites matching /src\\\\commands\\\\generate\\\\page\\\\__tests__\\\\page.test.js/i.\nDone in 9.28s.</code></pre></div>","id":"d380d15b-585c-5f5d-999c-4a190bc2d36a","fields":{"slug":"/2020-06-21/running-specific-tests-redwoodjs/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-21","title":"Running specific tests in RedwoodJS core","category":"RedwoodJS","tags":["RedwoodJS","Testing","JavaScript","Jest"],"banner":"/assets/bg/4.jpg"},"timeToRead":2}}}}
