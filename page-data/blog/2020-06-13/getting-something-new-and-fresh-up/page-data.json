The idea is like most every other blog on the Internet to just have a braindump. Whenever I find something interesting, or make something worth sharing, I will put it here. The first thing I want to share is how I got this page to where it is right now. So that will be my next blog post.

It is assumed that you already have <a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Git for Windows</a> installed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/rsync_windows.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of rsync running in PowerShell\" title=\"rsync screenshot\"></p>\n<p>If you didn't already know, Git for Windows and its Git Bash environment is built using <a href=\"http://msys2.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">msys2</a>, but it doesn't include all the binaries from that project. One of the binaries that exists, but that isn't included, is rsync. So what we need to do is to download the msys2 rsync binary, and place it somewhere Git Bash can find it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"http://repo.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://repo.msys2.org/msys/x86_64/</a> and download the latest version of rsync (not rsync2). At the time of this writing that is rsync-3.1.3-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz</li>\n<li>Extract the downloaded archive. I'm using Total Commander with a .xz plugin, but 7-zip is also a great option. Download and install from <a href=\"https://www.7-zip.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.7-zip.org/</a> if you need to.</li>\n<li>Copy the contents of the extracted archive (sub-folders and all) to where you have Git for Windows installed. For me that's <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Program Files\\Git\\</code>. (The archive contains a <code class=\"language-text\">\\usr</code> folder, and so does the git installation directory. What you want is for everything inside of the <code class=\"language-text\">\\usr</code> folder in the archive to end up in the <code class=\"language-text\">\\usr</code> folder in the git installation directory, ultimately ending up with, among other files, <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\rsync.exe</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's it. You now have rsync installed. You can test your installation by opening up a Git Bash command line window and running <code class=\"language-text\">rsync --version</code>. You should see it print out version information.</p>\n<p>Now, if you want to use rsync from the Windows Command Prompt, or from PowerShell, there is one more step.</p>\n<p>Create a new <code class=\"language-text\">.bat</code> file with the following content (adjust the path to match your environment)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"batch\"><pre class=\"language-batch\"><code class=\"language-batch\">\"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\rsync.exe\" %* </code></pre></div>\n<p>Name the file <code class=\"language-text\">rsync.bat</code> and place it somewhere in your %PATH%. I placed mine in <code class=\"language-text\">C:\\Windows\\</code>. Press <span class=\"nowrap\"><kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd></span> and enter <code class=\"language-text\">cmd</code>. In the Command Prompt window that you just launched, enter <code class=\"language-text\">rsync --version</code> and it will find your <code class=\"language-text\">.bat</code>-file and run it, passing all arguments (that's what <code class=\"language-text\">%*</code> does in the command above) off to your newly installed rsync.exe</p>\n<p>The first three steps above are based on <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/questions/310337/using-rsync-from-msysgit-for-binary-files/872557#872557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://serverfault.com/questions/310337/using-rsync-from-msysgit-for-binary-files/872557#872557</a> where you can also find instructions for setting up Pageant for SSH, if that's something you need.</p>\n<p>I hope this short tutorial was useful to you. Happy rsyncing!</p>","id":"68d4da1a-f515-509f-8738-1d78198954b5","fields":{"slug":"/2020-06-15/installing-rsync-on-windows/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-15","title":"Installing rsync on Windows","category":"Windows/Linux","tags":["rsync","Tools","Git","Windows"],"banner":"/assets/bg/4.jpg"},"timeToRead":2}}}}
